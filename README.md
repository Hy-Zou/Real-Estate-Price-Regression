First try of stacking model
Thanks to https://www.kaggle.com/serigne/stacked-regressions-top-4-on-leaderboard/notebook, which contributes a lot to the idea of stacking modeling.
The notebook involves a story of combining Lasso, XGBoost, Gaussian Process Regressor and KernelRidge by stacking method to test the performance of each componenets and the whole stacking one. Finally the result turns out that the stacking model defeat all three base models, as well as other ensemble models. 
Result shows the stacking model defeat all base models, as well as avoid the overfitting problem.
