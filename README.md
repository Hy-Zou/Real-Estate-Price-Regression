First try of stacking model
Thanks to https://www.kaggle.com/serigne/stacked-regressions-top-4-on-leaderboard/notebook, which contributes a lot to the idea of stacking modeling.
The notebook involves a primary story of combining Lasso, AdaBoost and XGBoost by stacking method to test the performance of each componenets and the whole stacking one. Finally the result turns out that the stacking model defeat all other three, which could be taken into account when another try.
