# Real-Estate-Price-Regression
Thanks to https://www.kaggle.com/serigne/stacked-regressions-top-4-on-leaderboard/notebook, which contributes a lot to the idea of stacking modeling. <br/>
The notebook involves a story of combining Lasso, XGBoost, Gaussian Process Regressor and KernelRidge by stacking method to test the performance of each base models and the whole stacking one. The problem is about regression for real estate price. <https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/notebooks> The result suggests that the stacking model defeat all three base models, as well as other ensemble models, and at the same time avoid the overfitting problem.
